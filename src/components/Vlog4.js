          <h1>4 Things To Consider When Painting Your House in Summers</h1>
          <img src="vlogs/vlog4/thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Though painting your house sounds fun and exciting, there are a few
            considerations to keep in mind before splashing your home with any
            colour. The first point to assess before stepping into the activity
            is the season. Summertime happens to be the best time to paint your
            home, due to minimal rain and optimal warmth which make painting a
            hassle-free task. This applies especially to the tropical Indian
            summer.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, there are a few points to consider while painting your home
            in the summer. They are as listed below:
          </p>
          <h2>1.The Type of Paints you plan to use for your home</h2>
          <p>
            As you know, the exterior of your house is exposed to extreme
            conditions, as such it is vital to know about the most appropriate
            paints that can stand the test of time. While the interior is safer,
            and more protected from harsh conditions, you wouldn’t want to
            compromise on the quality of paints used inside either.
          </p>
          <p>Here are the types of paints one could consider using:</p>
          <img src="vlogs/vlog4/img1.jpg" alt="" />
          <h3>-Dirtproof and Waterproof Exterior Paint</h3>
          <p>
            As the name suggests, this paint is perfect for the exterior of your
            home. Offering protection from dirt and moisture, these will reward
            you with fresh-looking walls for many years to come.
          </p>
          <h3>-Exterior and Interior Acrylic Laminate</h3>
          <p>
            These premium quality paints for your house, are perfect for both
            exteriors and interiors, and can fulfil the level of finesse you
            wish to achieve. This water-repelling wall paint keeps your home
            safe from fungal attacks and minimises the need to rework for a long
            time.
          </p>
          <h3>-Luxury Interior Paint</h3>
          <p>
            A soft, glowing finish in your home colour shade can help exude
            luxury in the interiors. These interior paints are composed of pure
            acrylics and offer you the ease of cleaning. Do you keep dreaming of
            spotless interior walls? Well, here’s your dream come true with a
            perfect house wall colour, splashed with the glam quotient.
          </p>
          <h2>2.It’s all about the right timing!</h2>
        <p>
          Though summers last long, it doesn’t mean that every month can support
          your house painting activity. Consider the months from April to June
          with subtle warmth and almost no moisture. While late summers might
          obstruct the task with monsoons, the extreme summers must also be
          avoided as well, since too much heat might cause the house wall paint
          to dry out.
        </p>
        <h2>3.Consider using UV-resistant Paints for your House</h2>

        <p>
          As the summer season has various advantages for house painting, the
          harmful UV rays of the sun cannot be neglected. It is important to
          make sure whichever home colour shade you decide to go ahead with,
          must have a high resistance to UV rays to prevent any damages to the
          overall look.
        </p>
        <h2>
          4.Choose the best Paint Colours for your House as per your taste
        </h2>
        <p>
          When the timing is all set, the next big question arises: Which paint
          colours for house will look good on your property? Choosing a good
          home colour shade is not an easy task. It needs one to be creative, to
          find the perfect match for your home, which in return will reflect
          your personality. With endless options to choose from, apply test
          coats of the wall colour that appeal to you the most and enhance the
          aesthetics of your home.
        </p>
